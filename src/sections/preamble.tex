\section{Preamble}\label{preamble}

\begin{flushleft}
	This workshop does not require any prior exposure to programming, though it would
	certainly be beneficial to you if you have used the command line before. In an ideal
	world everyone would be using a Linux-based operating system, but I am willing to make
	allowances for Windows users this time. With very few exceptions, most of the commands
	you find here work on any modern operating system. While there are many GUI clients for
	Git out there, it is not a stretch to say that nothing beats the terminal experience
	where it is meant to be used.
\end{flushleft}

\begin{flushleft}
	If you have never used the terminal before but you're keen on learning more about it
	then to jump to \pref{section}{powershell} if you're on a Windows machine, else go to
	\pref{section}{bash} (Linux and macOS\footnote{In 2019, Apple changed the default shell
		in macOS Catalina to zsh, although Bash currently remains available as an alternative
		shell.}).
